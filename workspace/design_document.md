# DAO Governance System Design Document

## Introduction
This document outlines the design of a flexible and inclusive governance system for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The goal is to develop an extensible interface that allows DAO members to define and automate workflows within their community. The system will support custom hooks, off-chain data verification, and community reward allocation.

## Problem Statement
Existing DAO governance systems require explicit developer involvement, limiting the available hooks and making it inaccessible to non-technical DAO users. The challenge is to design a solution that balances trustlessness, extensibility, and ease of use for DAO members.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is to create a set of classes and methods that enable DAO members to create actions, attach hooks, and execute workflows within the DAO. The core classes include `DAO`, `Action`, and `Hook`, with specific subclasses for different types of hooks. The system will also include a `CommunityRewardAllocation` class for allocating rewards based on user contributions.

***Bottom Line Up Front*** : It sounds like we want "IFTTT" for DAOs. So, basically rip IFTTT's front end and use it to do a UniswapV4-like thing in the back end, where arbitrary smart contracts can be supplied as pre- and post-action hooks.

## Trade-offs
The design of the system involves several trade-offs:
- Extensibility: The system allows DAO members to define custom hooks and actions, providing flexibility for different use cases.
- Ease of Use: The system aims to provide a user-friendly interface, potentially using a visual interface or simplified scripting language to define workflows.
- Trustlessness: The system leverages smart contracts and off-chain data verification to ensure trustlessness in executing actions.

## Implementation Details
The implementation will be done in Python, leveraging the `dataclasses` module for class definitions and `pytest` for testing. The core classes and their methods will be implemented as follows:

- `DAO`: Represents a Decentralized Autonomous Organization.
  - `create_action(name: str) -> Action`: Creates a new action within the DAO.
  - `execute_action(action_name: str)`: Executes a specific action within the DAO.
  - `add_hook(action_name: str, hook: Hook)`: Adds a hook to an action within the DAO.
  - `remove_hook(action_name: str, hook: Hook)`: Removes a hook from an action within the DAO.

- `Action`: Represents an action that can be performed within the DAO.
  - `execute()`: Executes the action.
  - `add_hook(hook: Hook)`: Adds a hook to the action.
  - `remove_hook(hook: Hook)`: Removes a hook from the action.

- `Hook`: Represents a hook that can be attached to an action.
  - `execute()`: Executes the hook.

- Specific subclasses of `Hook` will be implemented for different use cases, such as `TokenTransferHook`, `DynamicParameterExecutionHook`, `OffChainDataVerificationHook`, and `DeFiWorkflowHook`.

- `CommunityRewardAllocation`: A class that handles the allocation of rewards based on user contributions.
  - `allocate_rewards(users: List[str])`: Allocates rewards based on user contributions.

## Potential Challenges
- Ensuring the security and trustlessness of the system, especially when integrating with off-chain data verification services.
- Balancing the flexibility of defining custom hooks with the complexity of managing and executing them within the DAO.
- Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for defining workflows and attaching hooks.

## Conclusion
The proposed design provides a foundation for a flexible and inclusive DAO governance system. By allowing DAO members to define and automate workflows using custom hooks, off-chain data verification, and community reward allocation, the system aims to empower non-technical users and enable a wide range of use cases within DAO communities.
