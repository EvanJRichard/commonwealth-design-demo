The goal is to develop an extensible interface\nthat allows DAO members, not just developers, to define and automate workflows\nwithin their community. This includes defining hooks that are executed before\nand after certain actions, safely using DeFi apps without risking the DAO's\ntreasury, and allocating rewards to funders of a crowdfund, among other\npotential use cases.\n\nOur inspiration comes from the extensibility of hooks in Uniswap V4, Balancer,\nand Gnosis Safe and some of their additional modules. However, these systems\nrequire explicit developer involvement, limiting the library of available hooks\ndue to the technical nature of DAO users. We're also inspired by how proposal\nsystems work, pushing call data on chain to execute, potentially providing a\nlow-code pattern.\n\nYour task as the candidate is to design a solution that may be able to solve the\ntrilemma--trustlessness, extensibility, ease of use / level of coding. There is\nno perfect solution, therefore we're looking for a more research-oriented\napproach to outline some potential solutions.\n\nTo guide your work, consider the following case examples:\n\n- **Case 1: Token Transfer with Custom Hooks**: A user wants to transfer tokens\n  but the action is gated by a custom hook. The hook checks if the user's\n  balance is greater than a certain value. If the condition is not met, the\n  token transfer action is not executed.\n- **Case 2: Dynamic Parameter Execution**: A community admin wants to mint new\n  tokens for active users. An action is created with a dynamic hook that checks\n  the activity level of a user. If the user's activity level meets the required\n  threshold, the minting action is executed.\n- **Case 3: Off-chain Data Verification**: A user wants to claim rewards based\n  on off-chain activity.\n- **Case 4: Complex DeFi Workflow**: A user wants to borrow assets on a DeFi\n  platform. The borrowing action is controlled by a chain of hooks that check\n  various conditions such as collateral amount, collateralization ratio, borrow\n  limit, and current asset price from an off-chain oracle.\n- **Case 5: Community Reward Allocation**: A user posts frequently in a\n  community (e.g., Farcaster) and wants to claim rewards based on their\n  contributions.\n\nYour deliverable should be a design document that details:\n\n1. The trade-offs associated with your solution, considering factors such as\n   extensibility, ease of use, and trustlessness.\n2. How each of the above cases would or would not work in this system.\n3. Sources for research\n4. Can the code be built using GPT?\n\nAs a bonus deliverable, produce wireframes or a simple mockup describing your\ndesign.\n\nWe're excited to see how you will leverage these ideas and your engineering\nskills to build a more inclusive and flexible DAO governance system.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Areas that need clarification:\n1.

A \"token transfer\" action is an arbitrary callback that happens whenever tokens are moved. \"Dynamic parameter execution\" would allo. 4. Off chain data verification can be a hook into Chainlink. 5. This is another one that is intentionally broad.

The extensible interface should provide a user-friendly and intuitive way for DAO members to define and automate workflows within their community, potentially using a visual interface or simplified scripting language.\n2. The hooks in Uniswap V4, Balancer, and Gnosis Safe are limited by the technical nature of DAO users because they require coding knowledge or developer involvement to create and implement custom hooks.\n3. The token transfer action in Case 1 requires the custom hook to check if the user's token balance is greater than a certain value before allowing the transfer to occur.\n4. In Case 2, the dynamic parameter execution involves creating an action with a hook that checks the activity level of a user and executes the minting action if the activity level meets the required threshold.\n5. The off-chain data verification process can be integrated with the smart contract system by utilizing an oracle service like Chainlink to fetch and verify off-chain data before executing certain actions.\n6. The complex DeFi workflow in Case 4 involves a series of hooks that check conditions such as collateral amount, collateralization ratio, borrow limit, and asset price from an off-chain oracle before allowing the borrowing action on a DeFi platform.\n7.
