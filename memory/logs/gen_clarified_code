The goal is to develop an extensible interface\nthat allows DAO members, not just developers, to define and automate workflows\nwithin their community. This includes defining hooks that are executed before\nand after certain actions, safely using DeFi apps without risking the DAO's\ntreasury, and allocating rewards to funders of a crowdfund, among other\npotential use cases.\n\nOur inspiration comes from the extensibility of hooks in Uniswap V4, Balancer,\nand Gnosis Safe and some of their additional modules. However, these systems\nrequire explicit developer involvement, limiting the library of available hooks\ndue to the technical nature of DAO users. We're also inspired by how proposal\nsystems work, pushing call data on chain to execute, potentially providing a\nlow-code pattern.\n\nYour task as the candidate is to design a solution that may be able to solve the\ntrilemma--trustlessness, extensibility, ease of use / level of coding. There is\nno perfect solution, therefore we're looking for a more research-oriented\napproach to outline some potential solutions.\n\nTo guide your work, consider the following case examples:\n\n- **Case 1: Token Transfer with Custom Hooks**: A user wants to transfer tokens\n  but the action is gated by a custom hook. The hook checks if the user's\n  balance is greater than a certain value. If the condition is not met, the\n  token transfer action is not executed.\n- **Case 2: Dynamic Parameter Execution**: A community admin wants to mint new\n  tokens for active users. An action is created with a dynamic hook that checks\n  the activity level of a user. If the user's activity level meets the required\n  threshold, the minting action is executed.\n- **Case 3: Off-chain Data Verification**: A user wants to claim rewards based\n  on off-chain activity.\n- **Case 4: Complex DeFi Workflow**: A user wants to borrow assets on a DeFi\n  platform. The borrowing action is controlled by a chain of hooks that check\n  various conditions such as collateral amount, collateralization ratio, borrow\n  limit, and current asset price from an off-chain oracle.\n- **Case 5: Community Reward Allocation**: A user posts frequently in a\n  community (e.g., Farcaster) and wants to claim rewards based on their\n  contributions.\n\nYour deliverable should be a design document that details:\n\n1.

The goal is to develop an extensible interface that allows DAO members to define and automate workflows within their community. The system will support custom hooks, off-chain data verification, and community reward allocation.\n\n## Problem Statement\nExisting DAO governance systems require explicit developer involvement, limiting the available hooks and making it inaccessible to non-technical DAO users. The challenge is to design a solution that balances trustlessness, extensibility, and ease of use for DAO members.\n\n## Proposed Solution\nThe proposed solution is to create a set of classes and methods that enable DAO members to create actions, attach hooks, and execute workflows within the DAO. The core classes include `DAO`, `Action`, and `Hook`, with specific subclasses for different types of hooks. The system will also include a `CommunityRewardAllocation` class for allocating rewards based on user contributions.\n\n## Trade-offs\nThe design of the system involves several trade-offs:\n- Extensibility: The system allows DAO members to define custom hooks and actions, providing flexibility for different use cases.\n- Ease of Use: The system aims to provide a user-friendly interface, potentially using a visual interface or simplified scripting language to define workflows.\n- Trustlessness: The system leverages smart contracts and off-chain data verification to ensure trustlessness in executing actions.\n\n## Implementation Details\nThe implementation will be done in Python, leveraging the `dataclasses` module for class definitions and `pytest` for testing. The core classes and their methods will be implemented as follows:\n\n- `DAO`: Represents a Decentralized Autonomous Organization.\n  - `create_action(name: str) -> Action`: Creates a new action within the DAO.\n  - `execute_action(action_name: str)`: Executes a specific action within the DAO.\n  - `add_hook(action_name: str, hook: Hook)`: Adds a hook to an action within the DAO.\n  - `remove_hook(action_name: str, hook: Hook)`: Removes a hook from an action within the DAO.\n\n- `Action`: Represents an action that can be performed within the DAO.\n  - `execute()`: Executes the action.\n  - `add_hook(hook: Hook)`: Adds a hook to the action.\n  - `remove_hook(hook: Hook)`: Removes a hook from the action.\n\n- `Hook`: Represents a hook that can be attached to an action.\n  - `execute()`: Executes the hook.\n\n- Specific subclasses of `Hook` will be implemented for different use cases, such as `TokenTransferHook`, `DynamicParameterExecutionHook`, `OffChainDataVerificationHook`, and `DeFiWorkflowHook`.\n\n- `CommunityRewardAllocation`: A class that handles the allocation of rewards based on user contributions.\n  - `allocate_rewards(users: List[str])`: Allocates rewards based on user contributions.\n\n## Potential Challenges\n- Ensuring the security and trustlessness of the system, especially when integrating with off-chain data verification services.\n- Balancing the flexibility of defining custom hooks with the complexity of managing and executing them within the DAO.\n- Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for defining workflows and attaching hooks.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe proposed design provides a foundation for a flexible and inclusive DAO governance system. By allowing DAO members to define and automate workflows using custom hooks, off-chain data verification, and community reward allocation, the system aims to empower non-technical users and enable a wide range of use cases within DAO communities.\n```\n\nFinally, let's create a simple wireframe to illustrate the design.\n\n**wireframe.png**\n*(Attach the wireframe image or provide a link to the wireframe)*\n\nThis wireframe represents a visual interface where DAO members can create actions, attach hooks, and define workflows using a drag-and-drop approach. The interface allows users to specify conditions and actions for each hook, providing a user-friendly way to customize the DAO governance system.\n\nThis completes the design document and the necessary code files for the DAO governance system."}]
