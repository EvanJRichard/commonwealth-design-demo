We are seeking an engineer to delve into a complex challenge that involves
creating a more flexible and inclusive governance system for Decentralized
Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The goal is to develop an extensible interface
that allows DAO members, not just developers, to define and automate workflows
within their community. This includes defining hooks that are executed before
and after certain actions, safely using DeFi apps without risking the DAO's
treasury, and allocating rewards to funders of a crowdfund, among other
potential use cases.

Our inspiration comes from the extensibility of hooks in Uniswap V4, Balancer,
and Gnosis Safe and some of their additional modules. However, these systems
require explicit developer involvement, limiting the library of available hooks
due to the technical nature of DAO users. We're also inspired by how proposal
systems work, pushing call data on chain to execute, potentially providing a
low-code pattern.

Your task as the candidate is to design a solution that may be able to solve the
trilemma--trustlessness, extensibility, ease of use / level of coding. There is
no perfect solution, therefore we're looking for a more research-oriented
approach to outline some potential solutions.

To guide your work, consider the following case examples:

- **Case 1: Token Transfer with Custom Hooks**: A user wants to transfer tokens
  but the action is gated by a custom hook. The hook checks if the user's
  balance is greater than a certain value. If the condition is not met, the
  token transfer action is not executed.
- **Case 2: Dynamic Parameter Execution**: A community admin wants to mint new
  tokens for active users. An action is created with a dynamic hook that checks
  the activity level of a user. If the user's activity level meets the required
  threshold, the minting action is executed.
- **Case 3: Off-chain Data Verification**: A user wants to claim rewards based
  on off-chain activity.
- **Case 4: Complex DeFi Workflow**: A user wants to borrow assets on a DeFi
  platform. The borrowing action is controlled by a chain of hooks that check
  various conditions such as collateral amount, collateralization ratio, borrow
  limit, and current asset price from an off-chain oracle.
- **Case 5: Community Reward Allocation**: A user posts frequently in a
  community (e.g., Farcaster) and wants to claim rewards based on their
  contributions.

Your deliverable should be a design document that details:

1. The trade-offs associated with your solution, considering factors such as
   extensibility, ease of use, and trustlessness.
2. How each of the above cases would or would not work in this system.
3. Sources for research
4. Can the code be built using GPT?

As a bonus deliverable, produce wireframes or a simple mockup describing your
design.

We're excited to see how you will leverage these ideas and your engineering
skills to build a more inclusive and flexible DAO governance system.
